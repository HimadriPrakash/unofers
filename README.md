In this day and age of digitalization, everything seems to be
in the grasp of our hands but this isn’t entirely true for the
student community in regards to grocery shopping. As most
of the Colleges/Universities in India are situated outside of
cities or in remote locations, companies like Big Basket and
Blinkit don’t deliver things in those locations due to low margins
and thus increasing the problem of buying groceries specifically
for students/staff living on the campus who are already equipped
with all the workload. That’s where Unofers comes in and solves
all these problems by integrating local grocery shops on our platform
and enabling students to buy groceries through our website.
